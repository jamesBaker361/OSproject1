	For the first scheduling algorithm, you are required to implement a pre-emptive SJF, which is also known
as STCF. Unfortunately, you may have noticed that our scheduler DOES NOT know how long a thread will
run for completion of job. Hence, in our scheduler, we could book-keep the time quantum each thread
has to run; this is on the assumption that the more time quantum a thread has run, the longer
this job will run to finish. Therefore, you might need a generic "QUANTUM" value defined possibly in
mypthread.h, which denotes the minimum window of time after which a thread can be context switched
out of the CPU. Letâ€™s assume each quantum is 5 milliseconds; depending on your scheduler logic, one could
context switch out a thread after one quantum or more than one quantum. To implement a mechanism
like this, you might also need to keep track of how many time quantums each thread has ran for*/
